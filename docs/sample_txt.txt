Butterflies are insects that undergo a complete metamorphosis during their life cycle. This process includes four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly. The cycle begins when a female butterfly lays eggs on a suitable plant. These eggs hatch into larvae, commonly known as caterpillars, which eat leaves and grow rapidly. After several molts, the caterpillar forms a pupa, where it undergoes a transformation inside the chrysalis. Finally, the adult butterfly emerges, ready to mate and continue the cycle.

The entire life cycle can take from a few weeks to several months depending on the species and environmental conditions. Butterflies play an important role in ecosystems as pollinators and as a part of the food chain. Their colorful wings and delicate flight make them one of the most admired insects.
